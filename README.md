The project required us to do a report, make a prototype of our connected system and present our connected system to the whole class by the end of those 16 weeks. The project had us learn a lot about embedded systems and Web Development. 

Basically we had to use a BeagleBone Black Wireless as an edge computing device running linux, where you put some Python program on it and then connect 3 to 4 Mikrobus click boards (which act as inputs, outputs (displays) and sensors ) via a Mikrobus cape to the BeagleBone Black Wireless... the laptop then hosted the website and acted as "server" where the user can watch things change as you use the inputs from the  BeagleBone Black Wireless or send a input from the website back to the BBBW board and see it output something as a display

Below is a prototype of a smart light (from one of the team, each one had to do one subsystem), which has an occupancy detector and a dimmer <br>
